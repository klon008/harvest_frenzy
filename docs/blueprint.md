# **App Name**: Harvest Frenzy

## Core Features:

- Plot Generation: Generate a display of 3 to 5 random garden plots. Each plot has two bushes that may be blue, purple, or yellow. 
- Harvest Logic: Implement click events to gather the bush crop. By default, you are awarded 100 points when clicked, and then the bush dies. However, there is a 60% chance the neighboring bush on that plot does not die, and a 50% chance the crop doubles on the clicked bush's neighbor as well.
- Bonus Trigger: Add a 50% chance to x2 crops of bushes of all other colors (on all plots) when clicked after the intial click occurs.
- Regenerate Plots: Provide the player a "Play Again" button to regenerate garden plots.
- Point Management: Track, display and reset (between games) the total amount of points received from clicks.
- AI Assistant: Add a harvest assistant feature powered by a large language model tool to recommend the most efficient harvesting strategy, calculating the risks and potential bonus triggers to maximize the harvest total.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid yellow (#FFEA00), to evoke feelings of sunshine and ripe crops.
- Background color: Very light yellow (#FAF7E5). Visually similar to the primary, but soft and unobtrusive.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFB300), to bring some warmth.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a versatile sans-serif offering a modern yet slightly warm feel.
- Design custom icons for each type of crop and action (harvest, regenerate).
- Use subtle animations when crops are harvested or when bonuses are triggered to improve UX and provide engaging feedback to the player.
- Ensure a clear visual hierarchy with easily accessible controls to aid in ease of navigation and user experience.
